WTI Oil Price Prediction: Exploring Explainable AI Methods with Machine Learning Models
This repository contains the WIT Oil Price Prediction web app, which focuses on explainable AI (XAI) methods. The app allows users to explore and predict oil prices using machine learning algorithms trained on a selected dataset. The project includes preprocessing techniques, model training and evaluation, and the comparison of multiple machine learning algorithms for oil price prediction. The best-performing algorithm is chosen, and its decision-making process is explained using LIME, Shapley, and Counterfactual methods. The web app also features an interactive interface built with Streamlit/Gradio, enabling users to input feature values, obtain predictions, and access explanations generated by LIME, Shapley, and Counterfactual methods.

Key Features: Dataset exploration, preprocessing techniques, model training and evaluation, oil price prediction, XAI methods (LIME, Shapley, Counterfactual), interactive interface (Streamlit).

Explore oil price prediction and gain insights into the factors influencing predictions using this WTI Oil Price Prediction web app.

This app is based on Kaggle's WTI Crude Oil Price + Economic Indicators 10 Years dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/filteredtaph2o/wti-crude-oil-price-prediction
